Lunar Ray - Model Tools - Descriptor
====================================

In software development, the (domain) model is central to software. Many things 
revolve around it. Unfortunately, most of use of domain models are simple and 
repetitive. The model tools project attempts to fill in this void by providing 
a set of tools to analyze a domain model and perform specific actions based on 
the analyzed domain model.

All model tools assume that any domain model has a uniform meta-model. That is, 
there is a deterministic way to describe all entities and properties in the 
model. Assuming this is the case, any domain model may be analyzed and as such, 
any number of standard action may be applied to it.
